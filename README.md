####GoogleSearch

[Live on Heroku](https://googlesearch-musgrave.herokuapp.com/)  |  [Github Repo](https://github.com/StephanMusgrave/GoogleSearch)


### From your terminal:

### To run the unit tests:
  $ git clone https://github.com/StephanMusgrave/GoogleSearch

  $ cd GoogleSearch

  $ rspec

## Logic:

## Project Brief:
Create an site that searches google images based on a user selecting a coloured square.

Prep-Intro: 5 mins

Development Time: 2 hrs
for Junior devs increase this to 3 hrs
for Senior devs reduce this to 1hr 30 mins

Code Review & Walkthrough: 20 mins

Interviewer Notes:
This is an open test. Interviewee can use their own tools, libraries, books or internet sources to complete this task. Failure here is just as good as completing, we are looking to understand a coders ability to talk about what they have done, how they solved problems, what they weren’t able to achieve and how they would improve it.

Rails 4.x & Ruby 2.x should be used.

Requirements:

The user must be able to select the following colours: 
Red, Pink, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple
The search must use a random one of the following nouns as a search term and the selected colour as a filter: 
man, mountain, state, ocean, country, building, cat, airline, wealth, happiness, pride, fear, religion, bird, book, phone, rice, snow, water.
The colours must be presented as squares for the user to select
The top 5 search result images need to be displayed
The top search result needs to be able to be clicked by the user
The link will take the user to the image’s url
Show the list of previous searches in a dated list below
Newest searches at the top
Date, time, Noun, colour and http response time displayed
clicking on a previous search should rerun the search
Upload the working codeset to any online server (Heroku has free instances). Present the link & source code for review.
